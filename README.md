TutorTok addresses two crucial challenges in education: the difficulty for students to find reliable tutors and the lack of a platform for tutors to showcase their expertise. From the student's perspective, TutorTok offers a dependable resource to discover qualified and trustworthy tutors who fit within their budget. They can easily filter tutors based on price range and access previous ratings and reviews for transparency and trust. On the other hand, TutorTok provides tutors with a platform to spotlight their skills and connect with students who align with their teaching specialties. This two-way approach revolutionizes the tutoring experience, ensuring both students and tutors benefit from a seamless, authentic, and reliable educational journey tailored to their needs and preferences.

This web app uses React for a modular UI, Tailwind CSS for quick styling, and ESLint for code quality. Expressjs was used to connect to a chat API. Using chatengine.io, we integrated real-time messaging, enabling direct communication between students and tutors. This ensures a seamless user experience, enhancing communication and usability.
